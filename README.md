## Introduction
This Java program calculates the number of Sundays that fell on the first day of the month from the year 1901 to 2000. It uses a basic algorithm to determine the day of the week for each month and year within the specified range.

## Project Structure
- `Main.java`: The main Java file containing the program logic.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and information.

## How It Works
The program uses a loop to iterate over the years from 1901 to 2000 and for each year, it iterates over the months. It calculates the day of the week for the first day of each month and counts the number of Sundays.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```
